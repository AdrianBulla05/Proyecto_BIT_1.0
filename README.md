### Styles

Our CSS styles are organized in three categories. 

* Internal Stylesheet : applies exclusively to the Home page, can be eliminated in the future as the styles are migrated without problems to the style.css
* External Stylesheet : This is our style.css and it contains styles for the elements that are not associate with Bootstrap.
* Bootstrap styles: These are the styles that we applied with the classes that Bootstrap provides. These are applied mostly in the Home page.
